PKG Build Process
* Embedding data from package.json (Pre build processing...)
  > README.MD
  > index.js @module-@version
  >> As it relates to auto NPM Release packages


+ process to generate docs portal including docs from multiple packages, automated


+ packages/@tyler.thayn/js
	npm publishable version of @js/core min contents
	scripts: copy files, bump, publish


+ packages/@tools/**** dev tools
	bump +Similar, but pull version from dev to npm release
	dev_publish: top level publish a dev package to an npm release package



Operational Theories
* @publishing NPM Versions:content copy configs
	* Dev package.json (or possibly companion.json)
		* files: what to copy
		* commands:
			* instructions for dev package (rebuild/bump)
			* instructions to prepare npm version (copy/bump)

	? Place a dist
